# Discord Tracker

Work in progress Discord Tracker / Scraper / whatever. Mostly made to learn more about datamining, so it's very messy and buggy.  This scrapes things like strings, experiments, etc from Discord; pretty self-explanatory

# Installation
This is intended to be used as a submodule as it was developed alongside [Mizuki](https://github.com/nakoyasha/mizuki), and because I find it easier to work with submodules compared to npm packages.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/nakoyasha/tracker Tracker
```
